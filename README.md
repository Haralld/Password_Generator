# Password_Generator
# Description:
# This Python program provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for generating secure passwords.
# Users can specify the password length and choose whether to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and specific symbols (!, ?, _).
# The application dynamically adapts to window resizing, ensuring that text and layout scale appropriately.
# Built with the Tkinter library, it demonstrates practical GUI design and dynamic content scaling in Python.
